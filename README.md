# Random HTML/CSS Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of small HTML and CSS projects that I've created for practice and experimentation. Each project is a mini-website or a web component designed to showcase specific HTML and CSS techniques, design concepts, or interactive elements. These projects are simple and serve as a learning resource for web development enthusiasts.

Feel free to explore, learn, and use these projects as a source of inspiration for your own web development endeavors.
